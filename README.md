# KiCad - Othermill v2 PCB fabrication template

The Othermill v2 is a mini CNC/PCB fabrication machine. This template was created using documentation from [Othermill/Bantam Tools](https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001656833-KiCad) as well as documentation on the Othermill v2's capabilities.

N.B. This template should work for the Bantam Tools PCB milling machine or Othermill Pro, but they both have tighter trace width/space tolerances than the v2 (10/10mil vs 6/6mil).
